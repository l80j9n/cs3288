Number Theory (MA3Z7) 
Problem Sheet VIII
1. Let  d — the sum of the divisors of n.
(i) Show that 
(ii) Apply Theorem 5.4 to prove that[You may use the fact that ]
(iii) Deduce that σ(n) has average order 
2. A natural number is cubefree if it contains no cubed prime factor. By mimicking the squarefree case:
(i) show that for s > 1,

(ii) show that the number of c代 写Number Theory (MA3Z7) Problem Sheet VIIIPython

3. (i) Use the relation  where k(n) = µ(m) if n = m2 and zero otherwise, to show that

(ii) Let w(n) denote the number of distinct prime factors of n.
Deduce from (i) that the average order of 2w(n)is
